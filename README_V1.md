## Build instructions

### Starter info

Build instructions for GitHub/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_MinecraftPE_Backup_Worlds_Windows95MC\n";

This repository is an archive of all versions of my Minecraft PE world: Windows95MC\n";

Before you can use these worlds, please make sure of the following things:\n";

### Requirements

* That your storage location for Minecraft is set to `external`";

* That your device is running Android (it might work on iOS, but I am not sure)";

* That you are running a matching Minecraft version (a listing of what version each backup is using is listed in another repository";

* That your device has at least 20-512 megabytes of free space, and at least 2 gigabytes of RAM";

### Start

This is a backup of all the versions of the world, according to my journaling structure.";

The worlds are sorted by a monthly ID, starting at 1,July 2019, 2,August 2019, etc... up to 21,March 2021";

To start using the world, locate your device storage and go to: games/com.mojang/MinecraftWorlds/ then cut/copy and paste the directory containing the world code FdAKYKc6AAA= into this folder (you can also use the zip file and extract it) you do not need to remove extra files before running the game, just make sure not to do this while the game is running";

Please also make sure that there is not already another world in your MinecraftWorlds folder labeled Farmtopia.";

### Outro

once installed, you will have a copy of the entire world. You can now change any setting you want, and do whatever you want to the world. If things go wrong, just delete it, and replace the backup";

## Community instructions

There are some plans for this world that I can't do on my own. They include:

* Building actual computers within Minecraft within the world, capable of emulating all Windows versions

* No other community plans at the moment
