# World name

The world was originally just called `Windows95` as of the second backup, the world has been renamed `Windows95MC` as it fits better. I am still considering expanding it and making it an all Windows world, with structures related to all versions of Microsoft Windows. For now, I will start with Windows 95.

I am currently unsure what I will do to rename the world if I expand past the Windows 95 theme.
